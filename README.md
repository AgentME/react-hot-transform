# react-hot-transform

This is an adapter for
[react-hot-loader v1](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader) that is
compatible with [Browserify-HMR](https://github.com/AgentME/browserify-hmr).
See Browserify-HMR's Quick Example section for an example of
react-hot-transform in use.

**This project is unmaintained and outdated.** [React Hot Loader v3](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader)
now works as a Babel plugin, so it can be used with Browserify+Babel directly and should be used instead of this.
